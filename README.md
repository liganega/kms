# Binding with traces

These are Coq scripts for the formalization of the soundness and
completeness of the intuitionistic first-order logic with respect to
Kripke semantics.

The Formalization makes use of a variation of the Coquand-McKinna-Pollack
style locally named representation.

The scripts are compatible with Coq8.4 and Coq8.5pl2.
